### Project Description
 RetroWave is a whimsical Bluetooth speaker crafted from old electronics and scrap materials, embodying a playful spirit of creativity and sustainability. Born during a late-night Discord call, this project was a response to sound issues faced during a fun "useless project" marathon, turning discarded components into a functional and entertaining audio device.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
RetroWave addresses the pressing yet absurd issue of "over-engineered sound systems" that deliver far too much audio fidelity for everyday listening. In a world flooded with high-tech speakers offering pristine sound quality, there‚Äôs a dire need for a Bluetooth speaker that celebrates mediocrity. By using outdated components and scrap materials, RetroWave champions the art of intentionally low-quality sound, allowing users to enjoy music in a hilariously underwhelming way, all while reminiscing about the "good old days" of technology.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
Introducing RetroWave: the Bluetooth speaker solution that no one knew they needed! By repurposing outdated electronics and scrap materials, we're transforming yesterday's junk into today's nostalgia-fueled audio experience. This speaker boasts charmingly subpar sound quality, complete with crackles and pops that‚Äôll make you question your music choice.

To amplify the fun, each RetroWave comes with a quirky LED light show that dances to the beat‚Äîor sometimes just blinks randomly, adding to the delightful chaos. Forget clarity and precision; embrace the beautiful imperfections of sound! RetroWave isn‚Äôt just a speaker; it‚Äôs a conversation starter, a comedic performance, and a reminder that sometimes, less really is more‚Ä¶ or at least, more amusing!
